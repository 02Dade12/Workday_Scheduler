# Workday_Scheduler

This repo was created to show case my ability to use jQuery in a dynamic way. This is a work day calendar that can be updated by the user and the information will be saved in local storage. The descripiton time blocks will update by color to indicate if the time has past; if it's present time; or if the time block is in the future. 

Check out the screenshot below for nice viual!
